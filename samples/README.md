Here you can see a list of all the baskets inside the configured pantry. Every basket has some action buttons to `edit` or `delete` the basket.
Clicking on the edit button will bring you to the basket page.
At the bottom there's a input field which you can use to name and create a new basket.

## Basket page

On the basket page you can use the `textarea` to edit the JSON and update the basket content by clicking on the `UPDATE` button below.
