# pantry-dotnet Blazor sample

This is a simple Blazor app to show off some basic usage of the pantry-dotnet client.

## Index page

Here you can see a list of all the baskets inside the configured pantry. Every basket has some action buttons to `edit` or `delete` the basket.
Clicking on the edit button will bring you to the basket page.
At the bottom there's a input field which you can use to name and create a new basket.
